"""
For this challenge, create a bank account class that has two attributes:
    owner
    balance

and two methods:
    deposit
    withdraw

As an added requirement, withdrawals may not exceed the available balance.
Instantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account can't be overdrawn.
